State	Description
STOPPED	All operations suspended.
SCANNING	The Source board starts in this state, cyclically scanning the load. When load is detected, the Source board enters the LINK_ESTABLISHED state.
LINK_ESTABLISHED	If the Source board 'detect-mode' is set to 'plc' (see Source board configuration), the Source board retrieves the Sink board charging configuration over the data link and verifies it.

If the Source board 'detect-mode' is set to 'capacity' this state is intermediate.
PRECHARGING_DELAYED	This state indicates that charging is started, but the Sink board configuration setting 'precharge_delay_secs' is set to a value other than 0 and thus the pre-charging is delayed to this amount of seconds.
PRECHARGING	Pre-charging is started. During the pre-charging phase, the current slowly increases from the value of 'precharge_current_mA' to 'charging_max_current_mA' during the 'precharge_secs' number of seconds.
CHARGING	Charging is in progress.
CHARGING_FINISHED	The charging process is complete. See the "reason" status for clarification.
ERR_BAD_LINK	When a load is disconnected, the Source board is switched to this state. This error state is considered a normal ending phase of the charging session.
ERR_LOW_MUX_VOLTAGE	The Source board detects a low input voltage.
ERR_VOLTAGE_ON_OUTPUT	The Source board detects a voltage on the output contacts. EXPERIMENTAL
ERR_SHORT_CIRCUIT	Error state which indicates that short circuit was detected while scan procedure.

There can be several reasons when charging is stopped and system goes to the CHARGING_FINISHED state:
Reason	Description
REACHED_CURRENT_CUTOFF	Current cutoff is reached. See the 'cutoff-min-current-ma' sink configuration setting.
CHARGING_TIME_ELAPSED	Charging time elapsed. See the 'total-charge-secs' sink configuration setting.
CHARGING_FORCIBLY_STOPPED	Charging was stopped by the 'sink-stop-charge' command. See the command line tool documentation page.
CRITICAL_TEMP_ON_MUX	Critical temperature is reached on charge source (MUX).
CRITICAL_TEMP_ON_SINK	Critical temperature is reached on a charge sink (PLC mode only).
INVAL_CHARGING_SETTINGS	Error state which indicates that the charging configuration retrieved from a Sink board is invalid (PLC mode only).
LOW_BATT_VOLTAGE	The Source board detects a battery voltage that is below the 'batt_min_voltage_mV' value. See sink configuration settings.

The system state is also displayed by a LED on the Source board. This is used for maintenance purposes only. The following states correspond to LED lights:
State	Description
SCANNING	The system is scanning for the load.
"SCN" LED (green) blinks fast.
PRECHARGING_DELAYED	The system delays pre-charging/charging, load is constantly detected.
"CHG" LED (orange) blinks.
"SCN" LED (green) is solid.
PRECHARGING
CHARGING	The system is in the charge loop.
"CHG" LED (orange) blinks fast.
CHARGING_FINISHED	The charging process is complete, load is constantly detected.
"CHG" LED (orange) and "SCN" LED (green) blink fast simultaneously.
STOPPED	All operations are suspended.
All three LEDs blink fast simultaneously.
ERR_LOW_MUX_VOLTAGE
ERR_VOLTAGE_ON_OUTPUT	Global Source board error state.
"ERR" LED (red) and "SCN" LED (green) blink slow alternately.
ERR_LOW_BATT_VOLTAGE
ERR_INVAL_CHARGING_SETTINGS
ERR_SHORT_CIRCUIT	Charging error state.
"ERR" LED (red) blinks fast for the 'error_indication_timeout_secs' number of seconds (see the Source board settings).
